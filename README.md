# ⛑️ I-Helmet: Enhancing Miner Safety with Smart Technology  

![I-Helmet Showcase](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=I-Helmet+Showcase)  

## 🛠️ Project Overview  

The **I-Helmet** is an innovative, IoT-based safety helmet designed to enhance the safety of miners working in hazardous conditions. Developed as part of our final-year research project at the **Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology**, this smart helmet leverages cutting-edge technologies to detect environmental hazards, monitor health parameters, and improve communication in mining sites.  

This research aims to reduce the risks associated with mining accidents by providing real-time hazard detection, health monitoring, and proactive communication with control units and medical professionals.

## 🌟 Key Features  

- **🚨 Hazard Detection**:  
  Detects falling objects, cracked walls, and wet mine areas using sensors and image processing (OpenCV).  
- **🌡️ Health Monitoring**:  
  Tracks body oxygen levels, pulse rate, and temperature using advanced sensors.  
- **📷 Smart Camera Integration**:  
  Uses image processing and machine learning to detect accidents and hazards.  
- **🌐 Telemedicine Support**:  
  "Miner-Doc" app connects miners and doctors for real-time health monitoring.  
- **📡 IoT Connectivity**:  
  Seamless communication with the central control unit using LoRa modules and Wi-Fi.  
- **🛑 Toxic Gas Detection**:  
  Monitors harmful gases (CO, H2, Methane, LPG) and alerts the control unit.  
- **🍺 Alcohol Detection**:  
  Identifies miners under the influence of alcohol and notifies supervisors.  
- **🔊 Real-Time Alerts**:  
  Buzzers, vibrations, and LEDs alert miners to hazards immediately.
