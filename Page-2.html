        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2"> Mining industry is an unsafe and very dangerous
occupation for human livelihood. About 15,000 workers die from these causes
every year. This is because its employees can experience suffocation, exposure
to toxic gases, various earthquakes and rock falls. In the event of such an
accident, the control room will not be connected and will face very problematic
situations. For these reasons, the people who work there do their jobs
regardless of survival. At a time when people are still unable to address this
issue due to issues like this, we intend to create a safety helmet to address
this issue through this project. For the above reasons, the wireless helmet
that is expected to be created creates a network to minimize accidents. The
main purpose of our helmet is to check the health status of the workers in the
mine as well as the temperature at their location as well as changes in the
mine. It also ensures the safety of the employees working in the mine by
inspecting and monitoring the place of work. Here, the data obtained by each
employee is redirected to a main dashboard, which also facilitates data
analysis.</p>

is a major source of foreign exchange for the economies of developing countries
such as India, Argentina, Armenia and Sri Lanka. Saving the lives of miners is
the main theme of the project as a large number of people die annually due to
these mining related accidents. The highest occupational mortality rate occurs
in the mining industry. Various safety devices have been developed for this
purpose. Miners often wear only a helmet that provides light, which does not
provide the kind of protection that miners expect.
IT

imported from other nations. As a result, it is important to continue research
and development in this area. To alleviate these problems. It is important to
understand existing applications before proposing a solution. As follows, we
compared several research articles to our proposed system. IT based

by C. J. Behr, Three sensors on the helmet made by Hancke were used, an
accelerometer, air quality and an Infra-red (IR) sensor. These were used either
to detect if a miner has experienced a bump to the head or removed his helmet
and surrounding air quality. The three sensors were connected to a ZigBee
module. This module does all the processing and also controls the wireless
communication between separate helmets through the Contiki operating system
[2]. Prof. Dr. V.R.
According to research by Pawar and Rupali Arjun Shejule The helmet section
features a sensor network which incorporates the sensors like gas sensor for
hazardous gas detection, in our case; it detects carbon monoxide gas
concentration, an Infrared (IR) sensor to detect the removal of helmet by the
miner. Pressure sensor is employed to detect the autumn of an object on the
minerâ€™s head and humidity sensor to see the humidity of the mining environment.
Processing module (ATmega 328) collects the sensed data and alerts the actual
miner who has encountered the hazardous event. Data is transmitted through the
wireless node with the assistance of GSM module. to tell the opposite miner
that his coworker is encountering a dangerous situation, he is going to be
given alert through the GSM wireless transmission by flashing a helmet light
for a few times. Through the wireless transmission, data is additionally sent
to the bottom monitoring station [11].&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>

          <span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Safety
helmets are used as a mandatory accessory in everyday mining activities.
However, it is clear that Sri Lanka and the developing and developing countries
do not pay much attention to helmets. This is because of the fact that
mining-related deaths are now very common around the world. In the day-to-day
mining industry, its employees usually wear safety helmets. But it turns out
that most miners these days do their job without a safety helmet. It poses a
serious threat to their lives. This is because of the emergencies that occur in
rock mines as well as in earthquakes. In such cases, in the event of a serious
accident, immediate medical attention is required. Most likely it will go as
far as surgery. In the mining industry, there is a high safety risk. There are
incidents like rock fall, head injuries. Therefore, these hazards are directly
threatening to the safety of miners . In mines most dangerous event is heavy
objects fall to the miner's head. The main thing is miners must wear a helmet
to prevent hazards. Thus, the helmet is mandatory. Underground mines are dark.
Using the normal safety helmet has a flashlight. But only light is not enough
to get the safety of miners. Due to hazards, miners' lives take riskier. In
coal mines, the significant emanation is of methane. The methane discharged
amid and in the wake of mining operations is called Coal mine methane (CMM).
Lately, there have been numerous fatalities in underground coal mine blasts in
which methane was a contributing element. Additionally, methane is 21 times
more intense for ozone depleting substance outflows. The centralization of
methane if went through a range in the vicinity of 5% and 15%, it might prompt
blast. This scope of methane is known as the dangerous range. Methane can be
touched off effectively in this range with the nearness of a start source to
make a vicious methane blast that may spread within the sight of flammable coal
clean. Even if a normal helmet is worn, the miner will not receive adequate protection.
Sometimes
Miners hit the heavy objects like mining objects, hard rock which risks their
life. Another factor that affects the miners is the inhalation of hazardous
gases that provokes them in danger. In such a situation the miners fail their
normal safety helmet to communicate with the outside world . However, the use
of existing general safety helmets does not provide adequate protection for
miners in mine related accidents.
If today's
technology is not used, if something goes wrong in the mine, the miner will not
be able to find it or save his life. For these reasons, some miners express a
fear as well as a reluctance to work in high risk areas of the mine. Today,
helmets are manufactured worldwide to provide protection to miners around the
world.
Looking at
the major problems in the mining industry, we observed a set of common
difficulties, which are categorized into relevant components and listed below.&nbsp;</span><!--[if !supportLists]-->
